## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project allowed me to review the basics of HTML and CSS. It requires learning how to organize and anticipate upcoming tasks.

At the moment, the development is somewhat confusing, but I am hopeful that my working techniques will improve over time.

I had to pay close attention to the format of the .QR_code class in order to get closer to the requested result.

### Continued development

I want to pay more attention to project preparation in order to anticipate any issues. Writing the HTML code wasn't the biggest challenge. However, styling with CSS can be challenging. Therefore, I want to deepen my CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- ChatGPT : helped me pinpoint simple errors in my code and understand their causes.
- Openclassrooms : A French website for developing IT skills.
